      <description>About Me  Hi, I am Apurve. I&amp;rsquo;m a Machine Learning Engineer (or Data Scientist, whichever works) from India. Till June 2020 I was working as a Machine Learning Engineer at Housing. Previously I worked at Netomi where I helped build the machine learning pipeline for customer service chat and email bots. I have been programming in Python for more than five years. I prefer programming in a Unix shell, currently using Ubuntu 20.</description>

      <description>Posts This part is still under construction. Currently finishing two posts:
  I have been reading about Deepmind&amp;rsquo;s recent breakthrough in protein folding using ML. Will be sharing some thoughts on it soon.
  For a little while now I have been interested in Economics, specially Behaviorial Economics. I also did a course in the summer on Behavioral Science, which included a small project. I am doing a writeup on my learnings uptill now in the same.</description>
